# Final Project: L-Systems in Taichi

Contributors: Remus Wong, Chris Chen

1) Have Taichi installed. You can follow the installation instructions through the installation page in their documentation here
https://taichi.graphics/docs/develop/documentation/overview/install.html
2) Note that I was building this on Ubuntu so I am unaware of problems that might occur with other OSs
Run any of the treeX_XD.py

More information can be found in the Final Project Report.pdf
